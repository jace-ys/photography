Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jace, a travel and outdoor photographer based in the UK, dedicated to capturing moments based around landscapes, lifestyle, and adventure.

Originally born and bred on the little island of Singapore, I picked up a camera when I first moved to the UK in 2016 and fell in love with photography ever since. I started off with the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II but nowadays I mostly use a Sony kit for my work.

From exploring destinations filled with scenic landscapes like Norway, Iceland, Madeira, and Dolomites, I've come to love the great outdoors and nature. It's become a mission of mine to capture these beautiful scenes and bring them to life through inspiring and captivating imagery.
